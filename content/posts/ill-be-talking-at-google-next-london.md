You will be able to catch me on the Day 1 Keynote at Google NEXT 2017 in London alongside Google Cloud CTO Brian Stevens. I will be talking about the global migration of Lushâ€™s e-commerce infrastructure to Google Cloud in a record-breaking 22 days.

I was invited as part of Lush Digital to talk at Google NEXT 2017 about the incredible migration that my amazing Engineering team at Lush (Dan Richards, Lee Hill, Simon Ince and myself) along with two partners: Ancoris (project coordination) and Clarinet (technical) delivered within a record-breaking 22 days.
